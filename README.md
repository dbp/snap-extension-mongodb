Snap Extension for MongoDB
==========================

This package provides a straightforward way to integrate MongoDB database
connectivity into Snap applications.

The API is a work in progress, so expect changes.

Starting with 0.3, this library provides out-of-box integration with Snap.Auth,
but you will need to install the devel branch from the source repo:
